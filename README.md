### Farthest Point Seeding for Efficient Placement of Streamlines ([pdf][streamlines])
A paper on calculating and placing well-spaced streamlines which should be useful.

### The Topology of Symmetric, Second-Order Tensor Fields ([pdf][tensor-topo])
Some information on representing and visualizing tensor fields that could be
potentially useful.

### Tensor Visualization ([pdf][tensor-viz])
Some pretty straightforward slides on understanding tensors, hyperstreamlines, etc.

### A Brief Introduction to Tensors and their properties ([html][tensor-props])
These are some general notes with useful formulas about operations on tensors
and vectors. Includes some information about calculating eigenvectors that
shoudld be useful.
